# ordering-ordering
> This is an Online Retail Store themed Educational Spring Boot application made for DePaul University's SE-452 Object-Oriented Enterprise Computing Course. The following students worked on the application:
> - Ismael Fernandez
> - Sebastian Krawiec
> - Dilip Sai Reddy Mettu
> - Jay Kukadiya

## Milestone 1
### High-Level Requirements
The application should have the following functionality:
- Warehouse Functionality:
  - Since this is a school project, we only need a way to display and create warehouses.
  - Displaying and creating warehouse functionality would create enough tasks across the entire application.
  - There will be no updating or deleting warehouse functionality, as this would increase complexity and require much more work. If time allows, additional tasks can be created to implement this functionality.

- Maintain a Catalog of Products:
  - Page to Create a Product:
    - Products need to be stocked in the warehouse.
    - All product data must be entered into the system.
    - Each product should be unique.
  - Page to Update a Product:
    - You can't update information for an already existing product.
    - Updated information must be complete; no empty fields allowed.
  - Page to Delete a Product:
    - A confirmation is needed to confirm the deletion of a product.

- Order Products:
  - Page to Create an Order:
    - A limit should be set on the number of product quantities that can be ordered.
    - Products must be in stock in the warehouse before they can be ordered.
  - Page to Update an Order:
  - Page to Delete an Order:
    - If an order is deleted, we need to ensure that the product is returned to the warehouse.
